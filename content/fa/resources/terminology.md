### 1. **Bioreceptor**
   - The bioreceptor is the biological recognition element in a biosensor, responsible for specifically interacting with the target analyte. Common bioreceptors include enzymes, antibodies, nucleic acids, cells, and aptamers, enabling selective identification of specific biological molecules.

### 2. **Transducer**
   - The transducer converts the bioreceptor-analyte interaction into a measurable signal, which can be electrical, optical, or thermal. Types of transducers include **electrochemical**, **optical**, and **piezoelectric**, depending on the type of signal conversion.

### 3. **Analyte**
   - The analyte is the specific substance or biomarker that the biosensor is designed to detect. Common analytes in medical biosensors include glucose, lactate, DNA, proteins, and ions.

### 4. **Electrochemical Biosensors**
   - These biosensors use electrochemical transducers to measure analyte concentrations based on changes in current, potential, or impedance. Electrochemical biosensors are widely used in applications like glucose monitoring for diabetes.

### 5. **Optical Biosensors**
   - Optical biosensors rely on light interactions (e.g., absorbance, fluorescence, or refractive index changes) as the signal source. They are known for high sensitivity and are often applied in DNA or protein detection.

### 6. **Enzyme-based Biosensors**
   - Enzyme-based biosensors use enzymes as bioreceptors to catalyze reactions with specific analytes, generating a measurable product. Glucose biosensors, for example, often use the enzyme glucose oxidase.

### 7. **Point-of-Care Testing (POCT)**
   - Point-of-care testing biosensors are designed for rapid diagnostics in near-patient settings, such as blood glucose meters or COVID-19 rapid tests, enabling testing outside traditional labs.

### 8. **Detection Limit**
   - The detection limit is the minimum analyte concentration that a biosensor can reliably detect. Lower detection limits are crucial for identifying trace analytes, especially in early disease detection.

### 9. **Sensitivity and Specificity**
   - **Sensitivity** refers to a biosensor’s ability to detect small changes in analyte concentration, while **specificity** is its ability to detect only the target analyte without interference from other substances.

### 10. **Microfluidics**
   - Microfluidic technology handles tiny fluid samples in biosensors, often used in lab-on-a-chip devices, allowing for efficient and precise sample processing.

### 11. **Lab-on-a-Chip (LOC)**
   - A miniaturized system that integrates multiple lab functions on a single chip, enabling efficient sample processing and analysis. LOC devices are compact and ideal for point-of-care diagnostics.

### 12. **Wearable Biosensors**
   - Wearable biosensors are integrated into devices worn on the body for continuous health monitoring, such as fitness trackers or glucose monitors, enabling real-time data collection.

### 13. **Calibration**
   - Calibration is the process of maintaining biosensor accuracy by comparing readings with standard references. Regular calibration ensures accurate measurements over time.

### 14. **Signal Amplification**
   - Signal amplification techniques enhance biosensor signal output at low analyte concentrations, improving sensitivity. Nanotechnology is often used to amplify signals.

### 15. **Selectivity**
   - Selectivity is the biosensor’s ability to differentiate the target analyte from other similar molecules, crucial for accurate and interference-free detection.

### 16. **Limit of Detection (LOD)**
   - The lowest concentration of an analyte that can be detected but not quantified. The LOD is a critical metric for assessing biosensor sensitivity in low-concentration environments.
