## 1962: Invention of the First Enzyme Electrode

The first experiment marking the origin of biosensors was conducted by **Leland C. Clark**, known as the father of biosensors. Clark used platinum (Pt) electrodes to detect oxygen and trapped the enzyme glucose oxidase (GOD) near the platinum surface using a dialysis membrane. This method allowed glucose concentration to be measured through changes in oxygen levels and hydrogen peroxide production.

This innovation laid the foundation for future biosensor research and demonstrated the practicality of using biological elements for chemical detection, sparking significant interest and investigation in this field.
